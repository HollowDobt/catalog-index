# Library Index Project

## Introduction

The Chinese name I chose for this project may mislead many people. It is called "智库索引". However, its only function is to automate scientific research literature queries, and has nothing to do with think tanks.

Currently, this project is still in the development stage. The idea is to use AI to decompose the general retrieval process into multiple steps, and then use AI to actively perform retrieval and analysis. This is a project that is more of a practice project, but because of the extremely strict requirements for scientific research, it is not easy in itself. In order to speed up the initial stage of development, this project temporarily uses mem0 as the cache memory layer. However, because mem0 does not support direct operation of the graph database at the beginning of the project, it may be gradually replaced by other memory layers later.
